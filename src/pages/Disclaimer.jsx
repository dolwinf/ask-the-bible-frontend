        First and foremost, let’s clear the air: this is a Bible study app. Just like the
        Bible you might have on your shelf, in your bag, or on your phone, this app is a
        tool to help you engage with scripture. It's not a mystical portal to another
        dimension or a harbinger of doom—promise! It’s designed to make your Bible study
        more accessible, wherever you are.

          It does not replace the need for going to church:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          No app, no matter how advanced, can replace the community, fellowship, and
          spiritual nourishment you receive from going to church. Church is where you
          gather with others to worship, learn, and grow together. Think of this app as a
          supplement to your spiritual diet, not a replacement. Skipping church for the
          app is like skipping breakfast because you watched a cooking show—informative,
          but not quite the same thing!

          It does not replace the need for attending Bible study:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Bible study groups are a wonderful way to dive deeper into scripture with
          others, share insights, and learn together. This app can help you prepare for
          those studies or clarify things afterward, but it’s not a substitute for the
          rich discussions and shared experiences you get in a group. So keep attending
          your Bible studies—this app is here to make them even more fruitful!

          It does not replace your pastor:

        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Your pastor is there to guide, teach, and support you in your spiritual journey.
          While this app can answer many questions, it’s not going to deliver a sermon,
          provide pastoral care, or help with life’s big decisions like your pastor can.
          Think of it as having a Bible-savvy friend who’s always available—but not
          someone who can replace the wisdom and guidance of your pastor.

          It helps you ask questions you may not want to ask a person:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Let’s be honest, sometimes we have questions about the Bible that we’re hesitant
          to ask someone directly. Maybe you’re worried it’s a “silly” question, or you’re
          shy about bringing it up. That’s where this app comes in! You can ask
          anything—big or small, simple or complex—and get answers without any judgment.
          It’s like having a no-pressure Bible Q&A at your fingertips.

          It helps with daily Bible reading and clarifies doubts endlessly:
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Consistency is key when it comes to Bible reading, and this app is here to help
          you stick to that daily habit. Plus, if you find yourself reading the same verse
          over and over, wondering what it really means, this app can help clarify those
          doubts. And it doesn’t get tired of your questions, no matter how many times you
          ask—it’s endlessly patient!

        Is this AI evil and the end of the world?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
        Ah, the big question! Let’s travel back in time for a moment. There was a period
        when the Bible was only available in churches, in a language most people didn’t
        understand. Then, along came the printing press, and suddenly, the Bible was in
        the hands of everyone. Some people thought that was the end of the world too!
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-800 mb-2">
        Fast forward to today, and we have the Bible on our phones, in hundreds of
        translations and languages. And now, with the evolution of technology, we have AI
        to help us understand it better. Is this the end of the world? Hardly. It’s just
        the next step in making the Bible more accessible and understandable.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-800">
        Technology has always evolved to bring the Bible closer to people. Just as the
        printing press didn’t replace the church but made the Bible more available, this
        app doesn’t replace your spiritual practices. It’s a tool—a very smart tool—but
        still just a tool. So rest easy, keep studying, and maybe even crack a smile at
        how far we’ve come.
